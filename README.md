React-Jwt_Authentication — Fullstack Authentication Guide

A complete guide and README for implementing JWT-based full-stack authentication with Node.js + Express backend and React + Redux + MUI frontend. This document covers architecture, sample folder structure, environment variables, security recommendations, code snippets, Redux flow, and refresh token strategy.


Overview

This project demonstrates a secure, production-oriented authentication flow using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). The backend issues access tokens and (optionally) refresh tokens; the frontend stores, uses, and refreshes tokens to keep the user logged in while preserving security best practices.

Key principles:

Short-lived access tokens for API calls.

Secure refresh tokens stored in httpOnly cookies (recommended) or secure storage when cookies aren't viable.

Minimal sensitive data inside tokens. Use token to identify user and check roles/permissions server-side.

Centralized token refresh endpoint and logout flows.


Features

User registration and login

JWT access token + refresh token support

Protected routes on frontend and backend

Token refresh flow with httpOnly cookie

Redux toolkit for auth state management

Material-UI (MUI) components for polished UI

Error handling and token expiry handling


Technology stack

Backend: Node.js, Express, bcrypt (password hashing), jsonwebtoken, cookie-parser, dotenv, express-validator, helmet, cors

Database: OracleSQL— Sequelize.

Frontend: React Vite, Redux Toolkit, React Router v6, Axios, Material-UI (MUI).
